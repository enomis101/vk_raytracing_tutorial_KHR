# Vulkan raytracing

## Forked from: https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_raytracing_tutorial_KHR

## Things i've added: (some of the code taken from: https://pbr-book.org/)
* New camera similar to a fps game to move in the world with wasd
* Area lights (for now only one light is supported) {ch 14}
* Diffuse brdf {ch 8-9-14}


Is a forked repository based on Vulkan ray tracing tutorials, which has been enhanced by integrating shaders based on the physically based rendering (PBR) techniques from the book "Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation." Additions include a new first-person shooter (FPS) style camera control for navigation within the 3D world using WASD keys, support for area lights (currently limited to one light), and the implementation of a diffuse bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) based on chapters 8, 9, and 14 of the PBR book
